# Driven-Blister-Pack-and-Pharmaceutical-Pill-Image-Generation
"Driven Blister Pack and Pharmaceutical Pill Image Generation," which leverages **Stable Diffusion** and **Generative AI** to tackle the challenge of data scarcity in machine vision. 

## **Overview**

The project focuses on generating synthetic datasets of pharmaceutical pill images to fill gaps in existing datasets like MVtec, specifically aiding in industrial and medical applications. The generated datasets can be used for:

- **Pill Identification**
- **Counterfeit Detection**
- **Quality Control**

This repository includes two Colab notebooks:
1. [Blister Pack Image Generation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SBEFWsVADZLPGQ-0xhXp7Zyw1KS8Ar7g?usp=sharing#scrollTo=1TUetuxsuNS8)
2. [Pharmaceutical Pill Image Generation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lqEP7b4hpQvT6w4qtIxk4_zMqP6pttOe?usp=sharing)
